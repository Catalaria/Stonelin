I wonder… do you dream of things you cannot comprehend?
Honor is not earned on the battlefield, but here I am to prove otherwise.
The field of battle is my home already. I don't care if we have been exiled.
Albeit my ancestors never fought in these lands, their spirits guide my blade nonetheless.
Victory or defeat, these are nothing. Only honor endures after death.
The taste of blood, it still lingers...
The battle calls.
We are the shield against Graggar… yet they let incompetent gods to tell the tales. The nine gods must be destroyed.
I have trained my entire immortal life for this moment, yet it feels so fleeting.
The sun rises... on another day of strife.
Ah yes... The wind whispers of battle once more.
The silent cries.
Only one god did not falter. Why do you even dare becoming a slave to the others?
The only true remaining god is Abyssor. Anything else is finite mana and mere lingering of mad men.
I'd like to invite one to a dance of swords... Wait- N-Not you, bakatare!
Why die with honor if I can just kill an whaler WITH honor? Followers of Ravox are strange at best.
Aahh.. What a nice dawn. The ocean reverses its tides, and it sings as deep as the abyss...
You know what is funny? Interspecies relationships. These reformists are freeks for that heartfelt whistle.
By the fucking abyss, this island is horrid.
Can you feel it? mana is dying, yet these whales does nothing to recycle it.
Mmwhm... I wonder why elven soul tastes better than humen ones, when the humen soul is supposedly perfected?
Wait. It is Town on Rockhill, just rockhill, stonekeep? Enigmakeep? ALL OF WHAT!?
Emperor... stop talking to me in my dreams. I DON'T GUCKING CARE!!! LIAR! TRAITOR!!!
The reformists will fall. Their little alliance is nothing.
I will weave my own destiny under my lord.
Aahh... Abyssor, I beg you... give light to your son.
Elven souls... I must taste it again...
