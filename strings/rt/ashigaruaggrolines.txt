Unsheath your weapon, mainlander.
Your fate is sealed, fool!
This will be your end!
Die by my blade!
No mercy for the unworthy.
Your soul is mine to consume. You think the underslut will save you?
The abyss hungers for you!
You wonâ€™t leave here alive!
Taste the edge of my blade!
The ground shall swallow you whole!
I will send your soul to the abyss!
A warrior dies with honor, but you will die forgotten!
Defend yourself or perish!
This land is not yours assume authority!
Prepare for your reckoning. You shall be unmade!
I shall twist your mind until you beg for oblivion!
In the name of Abyssor, I claim victory!
Honor and Glory, for the abyss!
With your fall, your soul will be mine!
This battlefield is my home, you are not welcomed.
I will make your pity gods tremble at the clash of my steel.
