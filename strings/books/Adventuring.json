Guild Of Adventurers

Some say its like herding cats, others it be like  fool being upset with that fact, you will most likely do fine.

Adventurer Grading:
</p><p><br></p><p>

People who employ the Guild like to know they get what they pay for. Thats why we grade and certify Adventurers according to their competence. Giving out a certificate will also reflect back on the Guild so donÂ´t give it to madmen who will ruin our reputation.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Copper grade: A beginner, they should still prove they are worth your time by handing in a goblins head or some such as proof.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Bronze grade: Competent, should be able to hand in a artefact as proof of this.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Iron grade: Skilled. Should be able to win a duel over a Orc, or hand in two artefacts.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Silver grade: Someone of true skill! Should be able to fell a troll.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Gold grade: A legend of the trade!
</p><p><br></p><p>

Now onto your machines, the HAILER and HAILERBOARDS. When a HAILER consumes parchment, it will magically showcase the same piece of parchment across the many linked HAILERBOARDs, making it very convinient to relay your notices.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Managing the notices is easy, so here is what you actually care about, how you should monetize it! Its pretty simple, if the job can procure you monster heads, which is your main income, best leave it alone. If its some lowly priest asking for carpenters that can fix a hole in the church. bleed them dry, they are taking up precious space for something that actually concerns your guild!
